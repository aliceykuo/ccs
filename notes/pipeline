ML pipeline
- takes in reshaepd 
- filtering 
	output shape specified 
	reshape it to output shape (downsize)
	post-process (filters and whatever else)
	-ravel add to featre matrix list with label 
	create feature matrix x, y 

	each row
	- standard scaler on feature matrix (X)

	and then models
- creates feature matrix 
- after pr

ML pipeline 


image - run kmeans on just the matrix ()


list of tuples 



FILTER TRANSFORM 
load into memory - np array
extra additional features from raw image 
- filter/transform (raw )
once in the post with the transform 
- extrat addtional features from post process 
- create feature matrix/ vector 
feature matrix 

then merge a raveled image with pre and post filters into one feature  matr

baseline - raveled filtered image + [re

1 784 + 3 + (features from after filters)
