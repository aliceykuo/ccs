sensory neural network

represenation learnign - reconstructing data 

reconstruction cross entropy - reduce 
goal - learn guesses - match orignal input


input - hidden - output matches 


let nn learn 
reconstruct with reduced dims 
- ss nn (learn reduced dims  non lin transform relative to )

activation - sigmoid, tanh

iterate - output for each ssnn is input for next - reduce dims 

dropout - stepsize, learning rate 
each layer - recontructing activations from the previous layer

two biases hidden bias 
visible bias (784) 
hidden bias - 600 (raveled feat_mat)
3 layers
