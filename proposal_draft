Motivation:

Data Analysis Plan: 

Build training set of images

Data: Pinterest search "wedding + beach" , "wedding + rustic"  etc 
Create image directory - one for each STYLE implied by search query used in Pinterest 

STYLE contenders: 
	beach
	rustic 
	modern
	glam

Image Scraping Status: 
	label 1 (beach): over 4000 images
	labe 2 (rustic): over 1000 images

STYLE contenders: 
	beach
	rustic 
	modern
	glam
	vintage
	barn/farm

Image Processing: 

Downsize and standardize image (50 X 50)
Convert image to RGB pixels 
Flatten image from 2D vector to 1 D vector - becomes feature vector 
Scale with StandardScaler 







object oriented image pipeline
take url - turn it into a vector 

download image - preprocess owith opencv 
flatten 2D vector to 1D - feature vector 
scale with standardscaler 
after feature matrix is built 

0 mean and 

training set - 

build class that does that 
target directory 
directory for each label 

download each image to each category's directry 
img/beach


goal - load into trainign set 

PIL - to downsize & standardize
